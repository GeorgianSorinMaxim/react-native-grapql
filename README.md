## The Project

- Uses Apollo Client, which is the best way to use GraphQL to build client applications. The client is designed to help you quickly build a UI that fetches data with GraphQL, and can be used with any JavaScript front-end.
- The local data is managed with Apollo Client using apollo-link-state.
- The Apollo cache is accessed using apollo-cache-inmemory.
- GraphQl server: https://github.com/apollographql/frontpage-server
